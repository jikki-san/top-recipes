    <h2>About this recipe</h2>
    <p>
      There's some manual labor involved here, but I promise it's worth it;
      nobody wants a random piece of onion showing up in their bite of
      guacamole. Make sure you add the tomatoes in last to ensure things don't
      get too watery. In addition, you should make sure not to overprocess the
      avocados when adding them; that'll keep your guacamole chunky.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you have a traditional molcajete and tejolote, that's awesome; I envy
      you. It's great for making guac. If you don't have one, a standard mortar
      and pestle will do nicely. You can use a food processor or a blender if
      you want, but in my experience that leaves you with microscopic, bruised
      pieces of cilantro. YMMV ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
    </p>
    <p>
      When you're searching for good avocados, avoid the temptation to squeeze
      them! This browns the inner surface of the flesh and you'll end up picking
      it out later. Instead, when testing for ripeness, take the small stem off
      the top of the avocado. If the flesh underneath is a nice greenish-yellow,
      you've got a winner.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1/2 white onion, diced</li>
      <li>1 serrano pepper, diced (optionally seeded)</li>
      <li>1/2 bunch cilantro, chopped fine</li>
      <li>Kosher salt (to taste)</li>
      <li>4 large avocados</li>
      <li>3 roma/plum tomatoes, cored and diced</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Add onion, serrano, cilantro, and a generous pinch of salt to a
        molcajete or mortar and pestle. Grind up the mixture with the pestle
        until you're looking at a questionable green paste.
      </li>
      <li>
        Take each avocado and use a chef's knife to slice it in half lengthwise,
        separating the two halves. Firmly (and carefully) chop down into the
        pit, turn your knife to release it, and pinch the pit on your blade with
        your knife hand to remove it. Next, taking a paring knife, score the
        avocado flesh 3-4 times vertically and horizontally, going all the way
        down to the skin, then use a spoon to scoop the resulting chunks into a
        large bowl.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add your questionable green onion-serrano-cilantro-salt paste into the
        bown with the avocado and fold it in using a wooden spoon, crushing the
        avocado pieces as you go.
      </li>
      <li>
        Finally, fold in the diced tomatoes until just mixed and salt to taste.
        Test with a tortilla chip to make sure you balance with the chip's
        saltiness as well.
      </li>
    </ol>
