    <h2>About this recipe</h2>
    <p>
      Queso can really be a blank canvas for you to do whatever you want with.
      The typical base is Velveeta and Rotel, but in some ways even that is
      negotiable.
    </p>
    <p>
      I've included two of my favorite add-ins here, but feel free to experiment
      with other items (green onions, other peppers, other veggies, etc.). The
      queso is your oyster.
    </p>
    <p>Maybe not oyster. Don't put oyster in your queso.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>32oz Velveeta</li>
      <li>2 15oz cans Rotel, undrained</li>
      <li>1lb chorizo</li>
      <li>1 poblano pepper, stemmed, seeded, and diced</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Set your slow cooker to low and add the Velveeta cubes, Rotel, and 1 cup
        of water.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat a nonstick skillet on medium-high, then add the chorizo. Use a
        potato masher to process the chorizo in the pan until all large chunks
        are removed (unless you're into that? Up to you, but it doesn't cook
        evenly). Stir occasionally to ensure it browns evenly, 5-10 minutes.
        Scoop the chorizo out, leaving as much oil behind as you can, and set it
        aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the poblano to the skillet and saut√© until softened and starting to
        brown, 5-10 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the chorizo and poblano to the slow cooker and stir everything
        together. Give it like an hour, testing occasionally to ensure that the
        cheese is evenly melted and warmed through.
      </li>
    </ol>
