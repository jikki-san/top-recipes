    <h2>About this recipe</h2>
    <p>
      You'd be surprised how easy making decent salsa is; it really
      <em>is</em> just as simple as charring some veggies and mashing them up. I
      hope this recipe gives you the confidence to ditch the Pace!
    </p>
    <p>
      One tip to keep in mind: add one pepper at a time, tasting as you go. You
      can only ever increase the spice level; once you've gone too far, there's
      no going back. If you're into that, don't let me stop you. But if you
      aren't, proceed with caution.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>4 roma/plum tomatoes, halved lengthwise</li>
      <li>1 red onion, cut into quarters</li>
      <li>3 jalapeños, halved lengthwise</li>
      <li>3 whole garlic cloves</li>
      <li>Kosher salt</li>
      <li>1 tbsp lime juice or red wine vinegar</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        In a large cast iron skillet over medium heat, char the tomatoes, onion,
        jalapeños, and garlic, turning them over so all sides develop a light
        char. The onions will probably start to fall apart and stress you out;
        it's all good. Remember you're gonna mash all these guys in the end.
      </li>
      <li>
        Transfer the charred ingredients to a molcajete, or alternatively load
        them into a food processor or blender. Crush the ingredients until
        they're just blended; don't turn it into a soup if you can help it.
      </li>
      <li>
        Transfer the mashed, processed salsa to a serving bowl and salt to
        taste, then add the acid (lime juice or red wine vinegar) to balance.
      </li>
      <li>
        Dip a chip (or a restaurant-sized bag's worth, manage your own macros)
        and enjoy!
      </li>
    </ol>
